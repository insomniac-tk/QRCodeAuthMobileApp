=========================== QR CODE SCANNER HOOKED TO A FUNCTIONAL MYSQL DB ================================================== 

This is the code dump for a mobile application that I'd worked on during December 2017-February 2018. 
During our college's  annual technical symposium 'TechXtreme', one of the problems that had persisted was of authenticating 
the entry of participants. The solution to this problem as we, the development team had figured out was to assign QR Codes
to every participant upon completion of their registration phase. This QR code would helped legitimize the identity of each
and every participant.

The next challenge was to be build a mobile application that would scan the QR codes of incoming participants. 
I was the app developer on the team and had single-handedly built the Application in Ionic Framework.
Due to sheer number of dependancies for any Ionic project(files like node_modules) it is vurtually impossible to upload the entire
project on GitHub. So I've uploaded only the code for the main landing and home page, their frontend HTML code and backend typer script.
Apart from the application, the server-side php source has been uploaded in the folder titled 'Backend'.
